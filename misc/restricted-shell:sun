Subject: Summary:  restricted shell (rsh) on SunOS
Status: RO

Many thanks for all the replies, folks!  Yes, there is already a form
of restricted shell on SunOS, hidden away in sh.

According to Jim Mattson <jmattson@UCSD.EDU>:
>Unless Sun has severely broken sh, just make /usr/bin/rsh a link to
>/usr/bin/sh.  You should find that this is how your rsh on the Iris is set
>up.  When sh starts, it checks the first alphabetic character of argv[0] to
>see if it's an 'r'.  If so, you get a restricted shell.

And, yes, this does work just fine!!  Thanks, Jim.

Also, from knutson%SW.MCC.COM@MCC.COM (Jim Knutson):

And, also from csmoko@relay.nswc.navy.mil:

According to payan@Corp.Sun.COM (Nozar Payandehjoo), the following works:
>Look into /usr/lib/rsh.  (This is linked to /bin/sh.)

However, I could only find this on one of our systems running 4.1.  Our
server (still running 4.0.3) didn't have this link for some reason.

Many thanks to all that replied!
