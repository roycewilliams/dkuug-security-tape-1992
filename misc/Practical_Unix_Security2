PRACTICAL UNIX SECURITY

O'Reilly & Associates has discovered that in the first printing of
_Practical_UNIX_Security_ by Simson Garfinkel and Gene Spafford (June,
1991) a formatting error caused the grave quotes (`) in the shell
scripts in our final PostScript files to be printed as forward quotes
(').  Of course, this breaks the scripts and is certainly not what the
authors, editor, or publisher intended.

An errata sheet is available from the publisher that corrects the
shell script examples and other minor technical errors found in the
first printing.  Please call O'Reilly & Associates at 1-800-338-6887
to obtain a copy of this sheet.  Alternatively, you may send email to
steph@ora.com, to request a copy of the errata sheet -- be sure to
include your surface mail address.

We apologize for any difficulties these errors may have caused.
