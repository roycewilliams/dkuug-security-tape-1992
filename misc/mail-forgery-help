The > prefix on lines beginning with From is also intended to cut down on
mail forgeries. Also, while "\n\nFrom " is present BETWEEN messages, the
mailer will often simply look at each line and, if it begins with "From "
judge it to be the start of the next message. You can confirm this by
eliminating the blank line between messages and see if your mailer still
separates your messages.

This is an arguable position. Separating messages certainly does waste
more space, but makes for a more complex directory structure by requiring
(for efficiency sake) a separate directory for each subject collection,
and makes movement between messages horribly inefficient.

The SunOS mail program that I use doesn't seem to use that as
a separator. I sent a message to myself containing "From me@here" in
the body of the message after two carriage returns, and indeed the ">"
was automatically inserted, but I directly edited my spool file 
and removed the ">". When I invoked "mail" to read it, It didn't
confuse the line in the text with the start of a new message,
even though the ">" was no longer there. Could there be some
control characters inserted somewhere?

I would place small bet on 4 CTRL/A's
because this is what about 50% of our mail system does at silicon.???.csusb.edu.
The other half  doesn't put in these characters
(Please don't ask me why - I assume insanity on the part of the programmers)
(whio would doubtless prefer to reamin anonymous)

The fun starts when a third process parses mail...this appears to use the
FIRST line to determine what the seperator between the messages is.

In consequence we often find 6 or 7 or messages all masquerading as a
single one...

I wrote a script to clean my mail out, then some others tried it as well.
As of tonight it went into service from root - as a crontab...It reads:
: clean dumb sentinels from mail files
cd /usr/spool/mail
for mbox in *
do echo $mbox
ed - $mbox <<++++ 2>/dev/null
g//s///
w
q
++++
done

By the way - g//s/// is not what it appears to be you'll have to insert
4 CTRL/A's    ^here
