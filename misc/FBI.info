Dear Security & Dasig Subscribers,

	Activated by a suggestion from William Sessions, Director of the
FBI, my associate Linda May and I scheduled a meeting with the local
Philadelphia office to discuss computer, information and network security.
We wanted to draw from their experience, learn their perspective, and
establish a direct conection with the poeple who can help us in the event
of an important security breach -- and to know what they can and can not do
regarding the subsequent investigation.

	We met with two agents last month.

	Our agenda included discussing security breaches (principal kinds
reported, principal deficiencies that enable such breaches, proportion
involving perpetrators external/internal to the organization, proportion of
organizations which had a security plan, program and officer, and the most
important factor(s) for achieving appropriate levels of security),
classifications of activities (legal, illegal and questionable), recaps of
proposed legislation, and suggested actions & publications.

	Regarding breaches:
	They said that banks are the most susceptible to loss, and that
most private companies absord losses without prosecuting due to the time,
expense, and the wish to not appear stupid.  They said that companies that
did prosecute breaches had fewer recurring problems.

	Universities tend to get more young hacker-types, while
corporations get embezzlers.  Most complaints are financial institutes that
get 'hit over the wire' (wire fraud), bulletin boards containing pirated
software & credit card access numbers, and, most recently, they are
beginning to get calls about virus problems.

	Although they were not allowed to give details, the FBI is
currently involved in two major virus investigations.

	They see a major problem being when a hacker receives 'celebrity
status'.  This encourages trying to beat the system since fame and not
disrepute is the potential payoff.

	Statistically, lower-level employees are easier to catch because
they leave a trail of their actions.  Higher-level (V.P.) employees know
the systems and leave less of a trail.

	Activity types:
	The FBI gets involved when a Federal crime is committed. Usually
this means either: 1)Crime involving more than one state, 2) crimes
involving gov't computers or gov't networks, or 3) the more broad 86'
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  Interestingly enough, one of the agents we
spoke with participated in the investigation which has lead to the
conviction of Robert Morris, Jr.

	A questionable activity, but not illegal, is when a hacker (or
employee) reads files they are not supposed to have seen.  Not so related
to universities is the new wrinkle provided by cellular phones.  In this
case the transmission travels through the airwaves to a hardwire
transmission point.  It is not illegal to listen in to the part broadcasted
(although, a recent note on the SECURITY list mentioned that it was illegal
to disclose an overheard conversation).

	Anytime we have a question about an activity we are encourages to
contact the agents & get the latest perspective.  Legislation-wise, neither
agent has received updates on the two 89' proposed acts: Computer
Protection & Computer Virus Eradication.  They said there is always a lag
time between when a law is passed and when they get instructions as to what
it means and how it can be used.  They can prosecute computer crimes now
involving threatsor harassment....and they said if they REALLY WANT to get
someone they'll research any and all laws to try to find something to stick
on the alleged criminal.

	They suggest knowing what data is sensitive and take extra
precautions.  Whatever security programs are running need to be monitored
and checked for patterns of unusual activity, i.e., send reports to the
user/custodians of each protected system.

	Lastly, to get around the undesirable impression of security being
iron-handed, they stressed the ned for an education program touching every
employee with a solid emphasis on WHY the security efforts (and the
employyees' efforts) are needed...and what can happen if the efforts are
not made.

	Based on an "OK" form the local agent-in-charge, both agents were
willing to come to this university and speak to our planned-for Security
Steering Committee, and without making specific recommendations, stress the
importance of having a full-time security officer-type and comprehensive
education/awareness program.

	Regards.
