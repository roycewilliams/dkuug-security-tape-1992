I set up port 1 on my terminal server, gave it a service name, and
passworded that service.  This protects the service from unauthorized
users getting into it from other terminal servers.  But I seem to be able
to use "lcp -h /dev/tty10:MYSERVER:PORT_1" and tip on Ultrix to get
direct access to the port and bypass the password.  So, too, could anyone
else out there in Ethernet land.  I guess the password is only on the
"service", not on the port itself?  I can set a password on the incoming
port right at the terminal server, but that's not what I want.  How can I
password the port and service so that access from Ultrix via /dev/ is
passworded the same way as is access from other terminal servers?

If Ultrix can get at the port without a password, this leads me to
believe that someone could write terminal server software that ignored
passwords too.  How secure is LAT?
