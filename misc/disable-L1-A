Subject: Re:  SUN L1-A and b -s
Status: RO


We use the following adb script to disable breaks on our server
consoles.  Users get kind of nasty when you inadvertently hit the
break key while trying to hit the setup key. This might provide an
additional level of security when augmented with setting all the
entries in /etc/ttytab to secure on the clients. We have this patch
installed on all of our Sun 3 and Sun 4 systems running Sun OS 4.0.3.
We don't have any 4.1.1 machines yet so I can't tell you if it will
work under 4.1.1.
