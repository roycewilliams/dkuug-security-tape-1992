If this were true, it would be a nasty security hole.
Just by knowing fsdb, I could look anywhere in a file
system and read the contents of files.

This doesn't happen here.  Based on information
available here, I have reason to believe
it doesn't happen with the major variants of Unix.
Anyone care to tell me if I am wrong VIA EMAIL
to avoid spreading any "how to break a Unix system"
information too widely?  Or better yet, if you find
a version of Unix that lets someone other than
root run fsdb and get information out of it (or
worse yet, change it), perhaps you might want to tell
your system vendor about it.  You probably don't
want your system to remain that way.

It is quite true, and you don't need fsdb [ but it sure does
make things easier ;-) ]

To prevent this your block devices can not be readable by
normal users.

fsdb -may- have its access modes restricted to root 
only, but this does not prevent someone from writing
an fsdb clone and posting it to the net so everyone
can use it.  However, any system which still has adb
on it has all that is really needed for file system
maintenance.

I have used adb [ just yesterday in fact ] to break
into UNIX systems.  My floppy devices are world
accessible, so I mounted a floppy and created a SUID
root program.  Seems I trashed /etc/shadow and couldn't
login as root ;-(

Sorry for the scare.  It was assumed that the user of fsdb would have
root access.  The whole purpose of putting a slash in the filename is
to prevent another root user from getting at the file text.  A chmod 600
provides privacy from mortal readers.

Putting a ^H into a file name also confuses people...

No, fsdb is not a security hole. The probabaly world-readable
character and block device special entries in /dev are the security holes.
I know about System V.2 and System V.3. In System V.2 all device
files are public readable to allow df to detremine the free block/inode
count. Maybe there are some other program that need direct filesystem
access.
System V.3 made all these special files unreadable for the normal user.
To determine the blocks/inodes count there s special systemcall.
The same things happened to /dev/mem and /dev/kmem.
System V.2: /dev/mem and /dev/kmem world readable;
System V.3: /dev/mem and /deb/kmem protected and s-bit on /bin/ps (non-root)

When fsdb is a security hole then the files in /usr/include/sys are
all security holes too, and Bach's Book 'The Design Of An Operating
System' is a security hole too. Almost all information to build
an fsdb on your own is in /usr/include/sys/* and some books.

Ok, I might be wise to protect fsdb from beeing executed by normal
user's (no problem, I think) to prevent looking at protected files.
But what about a copy of fsdb from somewhere else in some users directory ?

Get a machine and try out protecting the special files for the disks
and memory, and then do the right s-bit setting.
