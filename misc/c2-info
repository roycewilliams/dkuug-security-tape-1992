Subject: Re: shadowing password files
Status: RO



I recently asked for information about shadowing /etc/passwd without
implementing full C2 security on my 4.0.3 systems.  I would like to thank
all who responded.  This is a summary of those responses.

Most responses suggested that I edit rc.local so that it will start 
rpc.pwdauthd, a daemon needed for shadowing, but not start auditd, which
is required for auditing.

If you don't run C2conv, you'll have to create the shadow password and group
files, /etc/security/passwd.adjuct and /etc/security/group.adjunct, yourself.

William LeFebvre forwarded me a posting from Sun-Spots (can't tell what
issue, but dated May 7, 1990) by Jason Heirtzler that explains the format
of these files.

Hans Buurman suggests using a program, mkshadow, to create the shadow files
for you.

I should be noted that there IS a typo in /var/yp/Makefile. The line:
      make NOPUSH=$(NOPUSH) passwd.adjunct.time group.adjunct.time; \
should be changed by adding single quotes:
      make 'NOPUSH=$(NOPUSH)' passwd.adjunct.time group.adjunct.time; \


Also, yih%atom@cs.utah.edu suggests that I run C2conv, and then just turn
off auditing.  That might be the way to go.
