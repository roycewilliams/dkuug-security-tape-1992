Quotes from reviewers:

Cliff Stoll:
   Worried about who's in your Unix system?  
   Losing sleep because someone might be messing with your computer?   
   Having headaches from obscure computer manuals?

   Then _Practical_Unix_Security_ is for you.  

   This handy book tells you where the holes are and how to cork 'em up.  
   Moreover, you'll learn about how Unix security really works.
   Spafford and Garfinkel show you how to tighten up your Unix system
   without pain.  No secrets here -- just solid computing advice.

   Buy this book and save on aspirin.

Tom Christiansen, Convex Computer Corp:
   This book is the first I've seen that actually seemed to 
   address the many security issues that I keep around on 
   my own little list, and it did so well.

Paul Clark, Trusted Information Systems:
   The book could easily become a standard desktop reference for 
   anyone involved in system administration. In general, its 
   comprehensive treatment of Unix security issues
   will enlighten anyone with an interest in the topic.

Matt Bishop, Dartmouth 
   ...I liked the book; it covers a lot of material not
   normally covered and provides practical instructions on how to do
   things.  This will be very useful for practitioners...This book is
   far superior to any other I have seen on UNIX security.

Laurie Sefton, Apple:
   Finally there is a UNIX security book that covers the BSD world as
   well as the SYS V version...The other aspect of UNIX security books
   that has been sorely lacking was the "rest of UNIX" security.  All the
   other books had a very thin overview of "down and dirty" security, as
   if they were afraid of giving out too much information...As soon as
   this is out, I'm ordering copies for all my people, and extra copies
   for the library at Apple.
