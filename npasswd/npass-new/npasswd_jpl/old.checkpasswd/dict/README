README for checkpasswd dictionary programs 4/25/89

The programs 'makedict' and 'viewdict' may be build to use either the
4.3BSD 'ndbm' routines or the 'mdbm' routines provided in ../mdbm

Edit the Makefile to choose which option.  This option must match that
chosen for 'view_dict.o' in ../Makefile (for checkpasswd).
