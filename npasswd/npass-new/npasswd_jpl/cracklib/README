This directory contains an adaptation of the crack3.1
goodpass() subroutine to fit into npasswd.

By default, goodpass() will read /usr/dict/words.  You can cause it
to read other dictionaries by creating a config file with lines like
    dictionary /usr/dict/words
    dictionary /usr/dict/words.german
Note that specifying a config file overrides the default dictionary.

You should use the script dictprep.sh to prepare a wordlist for
use with this program; it compresses it and puts it in the right order.
It can also merge multiple wordlists; a merged wordlist is faster to
search than several smaller wordlists.

The default name for the config file is /usr/adm/checkpasswd.cf, but
the caller may set the name by calling setcheckpasswd,
e.g setcheckpasswd("-c", "/usr/local/misc/adm/npasswd.conf", 0);
