SNMPAUTH Minutes

The Working Group met for one evening to discuss the latest revision of
the documents.  There are currently three documents:


  1. SNMP Administrative Model - this document specifies a framework
     within which the protocols specified above funtion.

  2. SNMP Security Protocols - this document is a combination of what
     was previously the ``Authentication and Privacy'' document and the
     ``Administration'' document.  It completely specifies two
     enhancements to SNMP to support integrity and authentication, and
     integrity, authentication and privacy.

  3. SNMP Party MIB - this document specifies a set of experimental MIB
     objects that may be used to support the SNMP administrative model,
     including the SNMP security protocols specified above.


All three documents require some editorial changes, after which they
will be submitted to the Internet-Drafts directory.  The first document
is still pending approval from the IESG. Since the protocol document
depends on the model document, it may not progress to a proposed
standard until the status of the model document is resolved.

The set of slides used to present the administrative model and the
changes to the security protocols are included below.
