PEM II BOF Minutes

D. James Bidzos, President of RSA DSI, presented a summary of the
Organizational Agreement that will be required when PEM is made openly
available to the Internet community.  The status of the Organizational
Agreement with respect to the IAB standards process was discussed, but
not resolved.  It was pointed out that previous versions of the
agreement included security requirements.  These requirements have been
separated from the agreement and will be presented in a fifth PEM
related RFC that will be published with the revised RFCs.  The slides
from Jim's presentation are included below.
