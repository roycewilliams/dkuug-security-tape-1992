MINUTES

The AWG met briefly at the July IETF at Stanford.  The meeting was short and
basically consisted of announcements.  The following was announced by
myself:


   o The IP Authentication Option document will be submitted as an Internet
     Draft

   o Work is progressing on a document entitled "Authentication and Privacy
     in the SNMP" which attempts to address the issue of adding
     authentication to SNMP. This document is currently being worked on by
     its authors and should be ready to be circulated to the AWG on or
     before the October IETF meeting.


The next planned meeting of the AWG is for the October IETF.
