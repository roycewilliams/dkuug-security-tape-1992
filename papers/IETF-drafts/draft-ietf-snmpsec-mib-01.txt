          1.  Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it
          describes a representation of the SNMP parties defined in [8]
          as objects defined according to the Internet Standard SMI [1].
          These definitions are consistent with the SNMP Security
          protocols set forth in [9].

          2.  Status of this Memo

          This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as an
          extension to the SNMP MIB.  Distribution of this memo is
          unlimited.  Please send comments to the authors.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  They are:

               RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
               describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.  RFC 1212 defines a more concise description
               mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

               RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed
               objects for the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213,
               defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on
               implementation experience and new operational
               requirements.

               RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
               network access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.


          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [5] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [1]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly

          Internet Draft          SNMP Party MIB           December 1991


          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.

          The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1
          [6], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the
          SNMP.


          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains the specification of all object types
          contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined
          using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the
          extensions specified in [7].


          5.  Overview

          5.1.  Structure

          This MIB contains the definitions for four tables, a number of
          OBJECT IDENTIFIER assignments, and some conventions for
          initial use with some of the assignments.  The four tables are
          the SNMP Party Public database, the SNMP Party Secrets
          database, the SNMP Access Control database, and the SNMP Views
          database.

          The SNMP Party Public database and the SNMP Party Secrets
          database are defined as separate tables specifically for the
          purpose of positioning them in different parts of the MIB tree
          namespace.  In particular, the SNMP Party Secrets database
          contains secret information, for which security demands that
          access to it be limited to parties which use both
          authentication and privacy.  It is therefore positioned in a
          separate branch of the MIB tree, at the highest level
          possible, so as to provide for the easiest means of
          accommodating the required limitation.

          In contrast, the SNMP Party Public database contains public
          information about SNMP parties.  In particular, it contains
          the parties' clocks which need to be read-able (but not
          write-able) by unauthenticated queries, since an
          unauthenticated query of a party's clock is the first step of
          the procedure to re-establish clock synchronization (see [9]).

          5.2.  Instance Identifiers

          In all four of the tables in this MIB, the object instances
          are identified by values which have an underlying syntax of
          OBJECT IDENTIFIER.  For the Party Public database and the
          Party Secrets database, the index variable is the party
          identifier.  For the Access Control database and the Views
          database, two index variables are defined, both of which have
          a syntax of OBJECT IDENTIFIER.  (See the INDEX clauses in the
          MIB definitions below for the specific variables.)

          According to RFC 1212 [7], section 4.1.6, the syntax of the
          object(s) specified in an INDEX clause indicates how to form
          the instance-identifier.  In particular, for each such object
          which is object identifier-valued, its contribution to the
          instance identifier is:

               `n+1' sub-identifiers, where `n' is the number of sub-
               identifiers in the value (the first sub-identifier is `n'
               itself, following this, each sub-identifier in the value
               is copied);


          5.3.  Textual Conventions

          The datatypes, Party, Clock, and TAddress, are used as textual
          conventions in this document.  These textual conventions have
          NO effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any
          managed object. Objects defined using these conventions are
          always encoded by means of the rules that define their
          primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are
          necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
          adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

          ---    Definition of Initial Party Identifiers

          --  When devices are installed, they need to be configured
          --  with an initial set of SNMP parties.  The configuration
          --  of SNMP parties requires (among other things) the

          --  administration can obtain the delegated authority necessary
          --  to assign its own OBJECT IDENTIFIERs.  However, to cater
          --  for those administrations who have not obtained the necessary
          --  authority, this document allocates a branch of the naming
          --  tree for use with the following conventions.

              OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { partyAdmin 4 }

          --  since these allow secure SNMP communication to proceed,
          --  thereby allowing further SNMP parties to be configured
          --  through use of the SNMP itself.

          --  The following definitions identify a party identifier,

                      The creation/deletion of instances in this table
                      via SNMP Set-Requests is not allowed.  Instead,

                      side-effect of the creation/deletion of
                      corresponding entries in the partySecretsTable.

                      Thus, a SNMP Set-Request whose varbinds contain a
                      reference to a non-existent instance of a

                      must be corresponding instances of each object in

                      creation of instances in the partyTable (but not
                      in the aclTable or viewTable) occurs as a direct
                      result of the creation of instances in this table.

                      Setting an instance of this object to the value

                      match, then the object instance is not in the MIB
                      view.  If one or more match, then the object
                      instance is included in, or excluded from, the MIB
                      view according to the value of viewStatus in the
                      entry whose value of viewSubtree has the most
                      sub-identifiers.  If multiple entries match and
                      have the same number of sub-identifiers, then the
                      lexicographically greatest instance of viewStatus
                      determines the inclusion or exclusion.

                      An object instance's Object Identifier X matches
                      an entry in this table when the number of sub-
                      identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
                      value of viewSubtree for the entry, and each sub-
                      identifier in the value of viewSubtree matches its
                      corresponding sub-identifier in X. Two sub-
                      identifiers match either if the corresponding bit
                      of viewMask is zero (the 'wild card' value), or if
                      they are equal.

                      Due to this 'wild card' capability, we introduce
                      the term, a 'family' of view subtrees, to refer to
                      the set of subtrees defined by a particular
                      combination of values of viewSubtree and viewMask.
                      In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in
                      viewMask, the family of view subtrees reduces to a

                      indicates that the corresponding instances of
                      viewSubtree and viewMask define a family of view
                      subtrees excluded from the MIB view.

                      Setting an instance of this object to the value
                      'invalid(2)' has the effect of invalidating the
                      presence or absence of the corresponding family of
                      view subtrees in the corresponding SNMP party's
                      MIB view.

                      It is an implementation-specific matter as to
                      whether the agent removes an invalidated entry
                      from the table.  Accordingly, management stations
                      must be prepared to receive from agents tabular
                      information corresponding to entries not currently
                      in use. Proper interpretation of such entries
                      requires examination of the relevant viewStatus
                      object."

              DESCRIPTION
                      "The bit mask which, in combination with the
                      corresponding instance of viewSubtree, defines a
                      family of view subtrees.

                      Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub-
                      identifier of viewSubtree, with the most
                      significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
                      string value corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th
                      sub-identifier, and the least significant bit of
                      the i-th octet of this octet string corresponding
                      to the (8*i)-th sub-identifier.

                      Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
                      the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
                      determining if an Object Identifier is in this
                      family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
                      exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild
                      card', i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

                      Thus, the Object Identifier X of an object
                      instance is contained in a family of view subtrees
                      if the following criteria is met:

                           for each sub-identifier of the value of
                           viewSubtree, either:

                                the i-th bit of viewMask is 0, or

                                the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to
                                the i-th sub-identifier of the value of
                                viewSubtree.

                      If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and
                      there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
                      corresponding instance of viewSubtree, then the
                      bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required
                      length.

                      Note that when the value of this object is the
                      zero-length string, this extension rule results in
                      a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild
                      card'), and the family of view subtrees is the one
                      view subtree uniquely identified by the
                      corresponding instance of viewSubtree."
