Description of Working Group:

     The SNMP Security Working Group is chartered to determine the
     set of security services needed by the SNMP. The specification
     of those services, the supporting mechanisms, and the adjunct
     infrastructure will become an enhancement to the SNMP and
     eventually an Internet standard.

     The specification must not alter the fundamental SNMP network
     management philosophy and must not entail changes to existing
     SNMP standards or framework.

Goals and Milestones:

           Standard.

           Standard.

Ongoing    Submit specification to IESG for consideration as a Standard.
