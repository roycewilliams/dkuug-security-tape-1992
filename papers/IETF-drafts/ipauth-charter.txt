Description of Working Group:

     To brainstorm issues related to providing for the security and
     integrity of information on the Internet, with emphasis on
     those protocols used to operate and control the network.  To
     propose open standard solutions to problems in network
     authentication.


Goals and Milestones:


TBD           RFC specifying an authentication format which supports
              multiple authentication systems.
TBD           Document discussing the cost/benefit tradeoffs of various
              generic approaches to solving the authentication problem
              in the Internet context.
TBD           Document to act as a protocol designers guide to
              authentication.
TBD           RFC proposing A Key Distribution System (emphasis on
              ``A'' as opposed to ``THE''). MIT's Kerberos seems the
              most likely candidate here.
