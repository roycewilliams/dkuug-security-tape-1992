SNMPAUTH Minutes

The SNMP Security Working Group met for one day.  Three of the SNMP
Security Documents are available in the Internet-Drafts directory.  A
fourth document has been prepared in response to the many comments the
authors have received, especially those of the PSRG.

A few changes were made to the protocol specification, in response to
the comments.  These changes are reflected in the fourth document, which
will be submitted to the Internet-Drafts directory by the year end.

A presentation of the changes was made.  It was decided that the fourth
document should be short-lived.  Its content will be folded into the
other three documents, which will be submitted for review and approval
as proposed drafts at the March IETF meeting.
