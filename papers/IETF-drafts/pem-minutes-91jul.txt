PEM Minutes

The Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Working Group, Chaired by Steve Kent
(BBN) met for the first time at the Atlanta IETF meeting.  The Working
Group met on Monday and Tuesday afternoon and both sessions were well
attended.  The purpose of these sessions was to discuss unresolved
issues related to the Internet drafts which describe PEM processing and
the proposed PEM key management system.  The goal of this meeting was to
reach consensus on these issues so that revised Internet Drafts could be
issued and the Internet Drafts could progress to RFCs.  A number of the
issues which populated the meeting agenda were articulated in postings
to the PEM mailing list in previous weeks.

During the first session progress was made in resolving an issue related
to PEM message processing details and John Linn (the editor of the
relevant Internet Draft) agreed to make the necessary edits to this
Internet Draft.

There also appeared to be consensus on how to accommodate, in an orderly
fashion, a growing list of distinguished name attributes in PEM
certificates.  The proposal was made to register such attributes, for
use in all Internet applications which make use of distinguished name,
in the periodic IANA RFCs.

Other issues regarding public key management for PEM were discussed
including:


   o The role of RSADSI in the certification process,
   o Constraints on cross-certification, and
   o Representation of object class identification in certificates.


However, consensus was not achieved in the discussion of these issues
and other contentious topics associated with the key management Internet
Draft were not addressed due to insufficient time over both days of the
PEM Working Group sessions.

During the Tuesday afternoon session RSADSI presented proposed
organization and user registration procedures and corresponding legal
documents.  Copies of the organizational agreement were not available
for distribution at the time of the meeting.  RSADSI also described the
proposed agreement for distributing source code for the RSA cryptosystem
as part of a freely available, Internet implementation of PEM. Because
some aspects of this agreement are involved with unresolved issues as
cited above, finalization of the agreement details, etc., will require
resolution of these issues.

As a result of the lack of progress at these Working Group meetings, an

                                   1





interim meeting was proposed (later in the week) for September 11th at
BBN in Cambridge, MA. This Working Group also expects to convene again
in November at the next IETF meeting.
