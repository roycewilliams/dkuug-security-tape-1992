  Here's what I do to start COPS (I always ftp it and run it on any 
new system I'm on, being the paranoid chap that I am.)  Do the following:

0) type "./reconfig"

1) type "make"

2) type "./cops -v -s . -b cops.err"

(Or "./cops -v -s . -m user" if you want it mailed to "user", or whomever.)

3) Wait, or toss the sucker in the background and keep peeking at the result
file as it's growing (result.pid#) :-)   The result will either be mailed to
you (-m flag), or be placed in a directory of your machine name, with
the current date as the file name.)
