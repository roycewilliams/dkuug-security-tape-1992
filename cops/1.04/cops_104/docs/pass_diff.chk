since the last run.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pass_diff.chk
[
options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pass_diff.chk
is a front end for the
.I pass.chk
program.  All it does is run a diff on the last password file checked, and
pass the accounts with changed passwords to
.I pass.chk,
along with any options it is called with.  It will not run
.I pass.chk
at all if no difference was found.

.SH FILES
.br
.nf
old_passwd
passwd.diff
pass.chk
.fi
.SH "SEE ALSO"
pass.chk(1)
.SH BUGS
It calls
.I pass.chk
with the -P option in order to pass the difference from the last run.  So
calling
.I pass_diff.chk
with the -P option is pointless.
