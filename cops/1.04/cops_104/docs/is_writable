.SH DESCRIPTION
.I is_writable
can check a file to see if a file is either writable by group or by all,
returning either 0 if it is writable, or non-zero if it is not.
.I is_writable
also checks the parent directories, if a complete path is
given, for writeability.
Options are:
.TP
.B \-g
Check for group writability as well as world.
.SH BUGS
The Andrew File System, or Mach, or the combination of the two, apparently
plays games with stat(), the way I get the file info, so it can report things
as writable, when they aren't.
