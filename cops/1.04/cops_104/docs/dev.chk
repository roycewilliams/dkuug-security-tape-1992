.B dev.chk
[
\-g
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dev.chk
checks the permissions of /dev/mem, /dev/kmem, and
all devs listed in the file /etc/fstab for readibility/writeability (the
.I mount
command would be
a preferable way of getting the file system name, but the syntax of the
output is variable from machine to machine), and flags them if they are
readable by using the
.I is_readable
command, unless they are NFS mounted,
in which case they are ignored.  It also checks for unrestricted exported
NFS filesystems in /etc/exports.
.PP
options are:
.TP
.B \-g
Check for group writability as well as world.
