rc.chk  \- Checks contents of /etc/rc* file(s) for potential danger.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rc.chk
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I rc.chk
checks pathnames and files inside the shell script files /etc/rc*
(e.g. /etc/rc, /etc/rc.local, etc.) for writability.
It filters out all paths or files that have a /tmp, /dev/null,
or /dev/*ty, plus everything after a ">"; e.g. if crontab is writing
to a file it doesn't care.
.SH FILES
.br
.nf
/etc/rc*
.fi
.SH BUGS
Awk runs out of room ("bails out") if too many files are found in the
/etc/rc* files.
.PP
Spurious messages can occur --
.I rc.chk
only uses a approximation of which files should be checked.  Also, 
Unless a file has a full pathname (i.e. begins with a "/", it will
not be checked for writability.
