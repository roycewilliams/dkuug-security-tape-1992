   For those who need _fast_ password cracking, for whatever reason,
Matt Bishop wrote a fairly incredible password cracking engine, which
is detailed in:

"An Application of a Fast Data Encryption Standard Implementation",
Matt Bishop, Computing Systems 1(3) pp. 221-254 (Summer 1988).

  If you have a valid reason for using it, you can mail to Matt at:
    
   bishop@bear.dartmouth.edu

  for more information on his package.


  For an even better solution, try Matt's replacement for "passwd", which
allows you to configure it to your site to dissallow stupid passwords or
localisms.  Highly recomended, available right now via anon-ftp, at
bear.dartmouth.edu, in ~pub/passwd.tar.Z
