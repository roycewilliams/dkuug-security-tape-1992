 Possible improvements/extensions of the COPS package might (will?) include
(other than merely fixing bugs existing in the package) :

 0) Smarter detection of problems -- a lot of problems can be found in
configuration files; the way they are set up, not merely if they are
writable.  These aren't neccessarily hard to check for, but take someone
with a good understanding for the file to write.

 1) Better and more thorough Yellow Pages checking.

 2) Ditto for UUCP stuff.  Fix the perl stuff to work in shell, too.

 3) Once again for NFS things.

 4) Problems that are specific to a certain flavor of UNIX.  For
instance, HP-UX has different files in different places.  Perhaps
the system could look for and hunt for the vital files in the various
places rather than having to be put in a configuration file.  Also
support for various secure UNIX varieties; e.g. C2 level Sun, IBM's
secure AIX, etc.

 5) More problems to be added; by no means are all security problems detected
by COPS.  More potential hazards should not be difficult to detect -- merely
adding another module to the system or simply modifying what is here might
suffice.

 6) Trying to detect what kind of machine you are on, then acting on that,
possibly using larry wall's configure program.

 7) Automounters... a problem.  Can we divorce all the home-dir
accessing stuff?  Sounds interesting in theory, hard in fact.  Maybe
the perl version could handle it?

 8) Make a version/script that would run on a "fake" filesystem; e.g. a
full unix filesystem that starts someplace other than root ("/"), like
a diskless client or something.
