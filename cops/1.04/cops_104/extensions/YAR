  (YAR -- Yet Another README file)

    This is where the odds 'n ends go.
    "THINGS_2_DO" is a file that says what I'd like to see done, either
in COPS or in other packages.

    "crypto-stuff" tells you where you can get some programs to do
secure digital signatures.

    "questions" is a questionaire and some answers I recieved about
computer security.  It might prove of interest for general reading.

    "netstuff" is a short list of net.references for further information.

    "passwords" gives a reference for Matt Bishop's replacement passwd 
program, and his fast password cracker.

    "uucp.hardening" is a couple of articles taken from the net on how
you beef up uucp security.

    "writing.suid" is a nice writeup on how to write a SUID program correctly.
