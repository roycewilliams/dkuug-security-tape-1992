This is the locally developed program chkacct(1L) (an abbreviation for
'check account').  Its purpose is to check the files in your Unix
account for security problems which, if left as they are, might make it
possible for someone to break into your account.  chkacct(1L) will
present each problem to you along with a short explanation as to why it
is a danger.  You will then be asked if you wish to ignore the problem,
see more information about the problem, or have chkacct(1L) fix the
problem for you.

If you simply press RETURN/NEWLINE whenever prompted, chkacct(1L) will
always choose to fix the problem in the most security-conscious
manner.

There are three steps to chkacct(1L), if you do not see one of the
steps, then please see a PUCC General Consultant.
