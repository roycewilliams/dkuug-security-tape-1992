which will change the file to have a name of the form, "dangerous.<oldname>.x"
where <oldname> is the original name of the file, and 'x' is an integer.
For example, if your .profile was owned by another user, the fix would be
to rename it to be "dangerous.profile.1", assuming that file did not
already exist.  If it did, it would try "dangerous.profile.2", and so on,
until it acquired a file name which was not already taken.
