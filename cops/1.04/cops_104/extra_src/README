  Assorted programs and love songs that don't fit, are not polished enough,
or are just too miscellaneous to put in the general distribution.  Here's
a quick rundown on the stuff in this directory:

bad_dir.pl -- finds weird named dirs... things like "..." and stuff.  Use
	it like "find $1 -exec perl ./bad_dir.pl {} \;"

diff_last.sh -- gives you the difference between the last two cops reports
		that you have run.

mail.chk -- checks your mail directory for potentially bad things.

pass_mail -- scans through a COPS result file and mails a warning note to
	anyone who had their password guessed.  The note that is to be
	mailed needs a bit of editing to put site specific info in.

rhosts_sweeper -- checks for "+"'s in .rhosts files... should be run as root.

stop.make -- a quick way to make a starting suid stop file from scratch.

trust.pl -- this looks at your /etc/hosts.equiv file and resolves all the
		hosts that your host trusts, including netgroup stuff.
		This will be part of the satan project.

uucp_1.shar -- a nifty set of programs to help check uucp security.  This
		or the above will be melded into the next version of
		cops, but there just wasn't enough time with everything
		else going on...

uucp_2.shar -- the start of a comprehensive uucp checking program.  Comments
		are *very* welcome on this!  Must have perl, run in the perl
		subdir, or have the support programs in the dir run at.
