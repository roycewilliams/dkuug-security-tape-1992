#  Usage: cron.chk
#
#  This checks pathnames and files inside the cron files /usr/lib/crontab
# for writability.
#
#  Mechanism:  The commands inside the file /usr/lib/crontab are executed
# by root.  This shell script greps for commands/paths that begins with
# "/" and takes each potential problem-string and uses the program
# "is_writable" to determine if it is world writable.  All results are
# echoed to standard output.
#  In addition, it throws away everything that has a /tmp, /dev/null, or
# tty in the writable string, and everything after a ">"; e.g. if crontab
# is writing to a file it doesn't care.
#
#  Cron.chk will try to find a file in /usr/lib/crontab first (bsd),
# and then if it isn't there, it will look in the any alternate
# possible locations next -- right now, /usr/spool/cron/crontab -- to
# see if a directory exists, and, if it does, it checks all the cron
# files in turn.
#
#  WARNING!
#
#  Spurious messages can occur; a more stringent method (if perhaps less
# careful of a check) would be to test just the 6th field, instead of
# all the fields after the fifth.  Also throwing away /tmp, etc. could
# be a mistake.
