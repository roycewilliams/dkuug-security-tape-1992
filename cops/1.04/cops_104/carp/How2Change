  To add or delete checks to the base model, you'll need to add or delete
two lines near the bottom of carp.table (see comments in that file as
to exact instructions.)  In addition, you'll also have to add/delete the
check to "carp" too; see comments in that source file for more info.  Both
files use "bug.chk" as a sample program you may wish to add in the check.

  Why would you want to add/delete stuff?  Well, bug.chk isn't there
by default, and other checks may or may not apply.  Use your own judgment,
as always...
