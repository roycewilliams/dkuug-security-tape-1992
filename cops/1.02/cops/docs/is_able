.SH NAME
is_able \- Check for write/read\-ability of a file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B is_able
file {w|g|S|s} {r|w|s|B|b}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I is_able
can check a file to see if a file is either write/read-able by group or by
all, or if it is setuid/setgid, or a combination of these.  A first argument
of "w" or "g" determines whether it is to be world or group writable,
respectively, a "s" or "S" allows checking of SUID or SGID files, respectively.
A second argument of "r", "w", or "s", stands for readability, writeability,
or set[ug]id-ness, respectively; a "B" and a "b" stand for read and write,
and set[ug]id and write, respectively.
.I is_able
with a write option Also checks the parent directories, if a complete path is
given, for writeability.
.SH BUGS
The Andrew File System, or Mach, or the combination of the two, apparently
plays games with stat(), the way I get the file info, so it can report things
as writable, when they aren't.  Sigh.
