.SH NAME
cops \- Checks security of system for potential danger areas.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cops
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I cops
runs a set of programs that each check a different aspect of security
on a Unix system.  If any potential security holes do exist, the results
are either mailed or saved to a report file.
.PP
The following programs are currently executed by
.I cops
\-\- see the appropriate man page or other documentation for 
more information on each of the following:
.Ps
root.chk    dev.chk       group.chk
home.chk    rc.chk        passwd.chk
pass.chk    user.chk      cron.chk
misc.chk    is_able.chk   crc.chk
.Pe
In addition, it runs the U-kuang expert system, which runs these
additional programs:
.Ps
init_kuang  kuang         addto
clearfiles  filewriters   members
.Pe
.PP
.I cops
uses three internal variables that may be changed to determine where
who gets any reports generated, if it is to mailed or saved to a file.
The variable $SECURE_USERS is used to determine who gets mailed any
results.  $SECURE is the directory that
.I cops
is in.  And finally, if the variable $MMAIL is set to be NO, then
.I cops
will save the report in a subdirectory with the same name as the host
it is being run on, in a file called
.I year_month_date
, where these stand for the actual values, not that string :-).
Otherwise,
.I cops
will mail the report to the whomever is listed in $SECURE_USERS.
.PP
If the variables $ONLY_DIFF and $MMAIL are set to be "YES", then cops
will examine the last report saved to a file, and compare it with the
current one.  If any differences do exist, then it will be mailed; else,
the report will be discarded.
.PP
For the curious, or those that are gluttons for punishment, you can
set the variable $BIT_BUCKET to be a file, or null, for stdout, to see
all the error messages and such.  Some of the programs in cops print
out an error message if a file isn't found (for instance, if you put
a file to be checked in the
.I is_able.lst
configuration file, and it doesn't exist, it will not complain to the
final report, only here; by default, this is our friend /dev/null.
