 Possible improvements/extensions of the COPS package might (will?) include
(other than merely fixing bugs existing in the package) :

 0) Smarter detection of problems -- a lot of problems can be found in
configuration files; the way they are set up, not merely if they are
writable.  These aren't neccessarily hard to check for, but take someone
with a good understanding for the file to write.

 1) Detecting Bugs.  A very touchy subject, with so many sites without
source code to fix the bugs.  Depends a lot on how people react to this
package, and what the demand is for a package that finds bugs.  It would
be similar to the approach used in the rest of the package in that it
would point out the bugs, not tell how to exploit them.  For instance,
an example would be "Warning!  fingerd bug present!"

 2) Better and more thorough Yellow Pages checking.

 3) Ditto for UUCP stuff.

 4) Once again for NFS things.

 5) Problems that are specific to a certain flavor of UNIX.  For
instance, HP-UX has different files in different places.  Perhaps
the system could look for and hunt for the vital files in the various
places rather than having to be put in a configuration file.  Also
support for various secure UNIX varieties; e.g. C2 level Sun, IBM's
secure AIX, etc.

 6) More problems to be added; by no means are all security problems detected
by COPS.  More potential hazards should not be difficult to detect -- merely
adding another module to the system or simply modifying what is here might
suffice.

 7) Trying to detect what kind of machine you are on, then acting on that,
possibly using larry wall's configure program.
