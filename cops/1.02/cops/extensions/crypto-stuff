  Snefru and MD4 are both digital signature algorithms that are much more
secure than the crc producer in this package.  Snefru was posted to
comp.unix.sources, volume 21, I believe, and is hence available from any
c.u.s. archive site, like uunet.uu.net; MD4 is available via anon-ftp from
theory.lcs.mit.edu.  You might check them out if you're really serious about
your binaries and stuff.
