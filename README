			The DKUUG Security Tape.
			========================




   The purpose of this tape is to provide software and information, to
help system administrators improve the security at their site.

   The software includes a password-cracker "crack", a new passwd
program "npasswd" and the general security package "cops". 

   The information is a collection of papers on UNIX-security. These
include amongs others "The Orange Book" and RFC1244. There is also a
collection of clippings from the net, regarding different security
issues. 

Software Description:

   The "crack" password-cracker weeds out passwords, that are easy to
guess, from your system. It has two fases. First fase permutes the
userid and infromation from the gecos field, to try and guess
passwords. Second fase uses a dictionary to guess passwords.

   The "npasswd" program prevents users from using passwords, that are
easy to guess.

   "cops" is used to find security holes, not to prevent them. You
configure "cops" to achieve some goal, ie. to become root, and cops
will try to find a sequenze of steps, that can be used to achieve that
goal.

   "log_tcp" is a program to monitor the TCP services like finger, ftp
telnet and rlogin, if they are started by inetd.

Information Description:

   The "papers" directory contains the different security papers.

   The "worm" directory contains papers relating to the Robert T. Morris
Internet worm.

   The "misc" directory contains the miscelaneous clippings from the
net.
