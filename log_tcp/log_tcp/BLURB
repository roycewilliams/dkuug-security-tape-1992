This package provides a couple of tiny programs that log requests for
internet services (examples: TFTP, EXEC, FTP, RSH, TELNET, RLOGIN,
FINGER, SYSTAT). Optional features are: access control based on pattern
matching, and protection against rsh and rlogin attacks from hosts that
pretend to have someone elses host name.

The programs are nothing but small network daemon front ends. By
default, they just log the remote host name and then invoke the real
network daemon daemon, without requiring any changes to existing
software or configuration files.

Connections are reported through the syslog(3) facility. Each record
contains a time stamp, the remote host name and the name of the service
requested. The information can be useful to detect unwanted activities,
especially when logfile information from several hosts is merged.

Enhancements over the previous release are: support for datagram (UDP
and RPC) services, and execution of shell commands when a (remote host,
requested service) pair matches a pattern in the access control tables.
